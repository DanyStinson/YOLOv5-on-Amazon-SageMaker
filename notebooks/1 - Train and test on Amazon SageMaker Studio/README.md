## Train and test on a custom YOLOv5 model on Amazon SageMaker Studio

In the [Label your dataset with Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth]() notebooks, you prepared your custom dataset to train a YOLOv5 model (If you don't have a labeled dataset in COCO format please go to that section an create your dataset). 

In this section, you will download your generated dataset locally and start a training job of your custom model. Once the training has finished, you will be able to test it and see the results of the predictions.
